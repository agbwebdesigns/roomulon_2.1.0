# roomulon_2.1.1

This is a refactor of roomulon_1.1.5

I am modularizing the code to make it easier to work on and add to in the future.

I am using node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose to store all of the Objects.  

I pretty much have all of the endpoints to Create, Read Update and Delete all of the objects but, I still have to modify a lot of what were previously methods on the old version and refactor them to work with MongoDB and Mongoose.

Most of the logic should still work, I just need to rework the input/output of a lot of the methods.
